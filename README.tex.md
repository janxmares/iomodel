## IO model

* basic input-output model computes output, GVA and employee compensation multipliers

* based on sectoral input-output tables by CSU (10. 1. 2020)

# Approach
First, we normalize values in the IO table:

$a_{ij} = v_{ij} / v_{j}$ 

where $v_{ij}$ is the value of input from industry $i$ to production of industry $j$ and $v_{j}$ is the overall output of industry $j$.
